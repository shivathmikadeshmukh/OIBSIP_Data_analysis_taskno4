# 🏠 Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to build a linear regression model to predict house prices based on various features like area, number of bedrooms, location, and more. The notebook walks through the full process from data cleaning to model evaluation.

## 🎯 Objective

To develop a predictive model using **Linear Regression** that estimates house prices based on key housing attributes.

---

## 🔍 Steps Performed

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
   - Imported the dataset using `pandas`
   - Explored feature distributions and relationships

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing or inconsistent values
   - Converted categorical variables (e.g., location) using encoding
   - Standardized/normalized data if needed

3. **Feature Selection**
   - Identified and selected relevant features
   - Checked for multicollinearity and irrelevant predictors

4. **Model Building**
   - Built a **Linear Regression** model using `scikit-learn`
   - Split the data into training and testing sets

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated model using metrics:
     - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
     - R-squared (R²)
   - Visualized actual vs. predicted prices
